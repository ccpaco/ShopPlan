A conscious spending app that will consist of two main components:

1) A fund, like a bank account or spending budget. Hideable number for additional privacy. 
2) A list, like wants or bills to pay. The fund will preview how these item costs affect your account.

When a purchase is finalized, list items would be "archived" and the fund will get updated.
