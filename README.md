A conscious spending app that will consist of two main components:

1) A Fund representing a bank account or cash. Hideable for additional privacy. 
2) A list of purchases. These would be bills or things to buy. Also see a preview pf how these costs will affect your fund.

When a purchase is finalized, list items would be "archived" and the fund will get updated.
